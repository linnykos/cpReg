- Add some form of "prediction error" metric
- Add tests for the fixed sparsity way to do model selection
- Find a good way to empirically compute the minimum eigenvalue
- allow setting of gamma after-the-fact
- figure out a good heuristic for gamma (seems to depend on lambda)
 -- maybe i should be looking only at the NLL, not the lambda term?
- figure out why i have numerical instability
